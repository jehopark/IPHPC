Intro to Parallel and High Performance Computing @ CGU, Fall 2016

## Course Description:
The goal of this course is to introduce students to foundations of parallel and high performance computing in context of solving mathematical and scientific problems. Course topics may include: parallel computing architecture, distributed- and shared-memory processing, data partitioning, load balancing, performance analysis, parallel numerical algorithms, cloud computing, Map/Reduce, and applications of parallel and high performance computing. Students will be exposed to various tools and methods for parallel and high performance computing such as MPI, OpenMP, MATLAB, R, and Hadoop on national supercomputing facilities. A key aim of this course is to provide the groundwork for understanding and applying parallel computing concepts and tools to solve large-scale problems in their fields of study.
